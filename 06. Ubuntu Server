Well time for some more questions. Why Ubuntu and why server? With the exception of the RPI libraries, Ubuntu offers a lean full-service operating system for 
running our Minecraft server. So, for now We’ll work with Ubuntu but as the project grows, we will explore and provide info for running other 64-bit operating systems 
on your Pi 4.  
 
Right now we’ll need the raspberry Pi imaging software.  

 
Windows 
https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/imager/imager.exe 
 

Mac 
https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/imager/imager.dmg 

 

This software will flash your micro SD card with the appropriate boot image for installing the Ubuntu server. This is why I recommend using multiple SD cards. 
You can keep your Raspbian SD on the side for trouble shooting your pi since you know it works. Now just flash an Ubuntu image onto a new SD card.
At the time of writing, Raspberry Pi Imager was at version 1.3 
 
you have 3 options
 
Operating System				SD Card 

[CHOOSE OS]				[CHOOSE SD CARD]		[this option is darkened out] 

 
when you clock on [CHOOSE OS] there should be an option for Ubuntu when you click on it, it’ll give you a number of options. We will go with Ununtu Server 20.04.1 LTS (RPI 3/4)
Then select your (hopefully new) SD card. Then the last box that was darkened out should be active Click on it [WRITE] and the imager will start installing the 
Ubuntu image onto the card.
