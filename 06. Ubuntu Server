>>> Ubuntu <<<
**************

Well time for some more questions. Why Ubuntu and why server? With the exception of the RPI libraries, Ubuntu offers a lean full-service operating system for 
running our Minecraft server. So, for now We’ll work with Ubuntu but as the project grows, we will explore and provide info for running other 64-bit operating systems 
on your Pi 4. For now Ubuntu server uses minimal resources on our already low spec equipment.   
 
Right now we’ll need the raspberry Pi imaging software.  
 
Windows 
https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/imager/imager.exe 

Mac 
https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/imager/imager.dmg 


This software will flash your micro SD card with the appropriate boot image for installing the Ubuntu server. This is why I recommend using multiple SD cards. 
You can keep your Raspbian SD on the side for trouble shooting your Pi since you know it works. Now just flash an Ubuntu image onto a new SD card.
At the time of writing, Raspberry Pi Imager was at version 1.3 
 
you are pressented with 3 options
 
Operating System				SD Card 

[CHOOSE OS]				[CHOOSE SD CARD]		[this option is darkened out] 

 
when you click on [CHOOSE OS] there should be an option for Ubuntu when you click on it, it’ll give you a number of options. We will go with Ununtu Server 20.04.1 LTS (RPI 3/4)
Then select your (hopefully new) SD card. Then the last box that was darkened out should be active. Click on it [WRITE] and the imager will start installing the 
Ubuntu image onto the card. (yes, it can take a long time)(Verifying is optional, but just let it do you’ve waited this long, wait a little longer)   
 
once it’s complete, replace the Raspbien micro-SD card in the pi with the Ubuntu micro-SD card you've just written. Store the Raspbian card somewhere safe. 
Now power up the Pi. Unlike before, the Ubuntu server is preconfigured to accept SSH connection. You will be greeted by a log in. The Username is “ubuntu” and the 
password is “ubuntu”. You will be prompted to change the password. Type in the old password first “ubuntu” and whatever your new password will be. If using 
putty you’ll be logged out and prompted to log in again. If you are using a dedicated keyboard and mouse, and monitor, you just have to follow the prompt and log-in
with new password.

>>> Upgrade your Ubuntu <<<
***************************

The next steps you are familiar with as they are the same sudo apt update and upgrade from before 

Prompt 
Ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ [] 

Type 
Sudo apt update 
 
then  
sudo apt full-upgrade 
 
if you get an error that a file can’t be accessed because it’s tied to a process just reboot.  
 
while your Pi does the necessary upgrades for your new Ubuntu server let’s talk about some commands. So far, we’ve started every command with sudo. 
“Sudo” is a command prefix that gives your command administrative authority. It may also be called ‘root privileges’ so every time you type a command 
and it gets rejected, try using sudo.  
 
using your up and down keys in the command line will scroll through your previously inputted commands. This will come in handy as we o deeper into Linux. 
Once the update is complete type 
sudo reboot

and we are ready for the Minecraft portion of this project.
