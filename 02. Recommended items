What you’ll need  
 
Raspberry Pi 4 4Gb model (8Gb model recommended)  

appropriate power adapter for your model pi 

Key board and mouse

I recommend you get multiple Micro SD cards. The card that comes with your pi should have Raspbian OS but it may have the 32-bit version of Raspbian and we will be 
installing 64-bit operating system. This way once you have the updated Raspbian OS, you can keep it as a backup to troubleshoot your pi. 

 
 
Any kit for Raspberry Pi 4 will work, but the minimum recommended is the Pi 4 with 4Mb Ram. I have used and tested these methods with Raspi 4 8Gb edition. 
Canakit and Adafruit have full kits with Keyboard and mouse as well as power switch external power supplies and HDMI cables. It is recommended that you purchase 
a kit if you do not have a spare mouse and or keyboard. You can log into the Pi using SSH programs like Putty. If you have HDMI input video capture device, you 
can use that as a display to monitor your pi. Most pi 4 will ship with a micro SD card of 16 – 32 Gbs. It is recommended you by a few more  

internet connection of some kind. I connected my pi4 to my router. You can use WIFI but Lan (wired connection) is preferable.
