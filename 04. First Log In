Again, some questions to ask. How do you interface with your Pi? If you are using a dedicated keyboard and mouse and have your Pi connected to a monitor or TV, 
then you are greeted with a pretty robust GUI. And your pi will guide you through a setup wizard to set up your desktop. Once that’s done, you will want to open a 
terminal window once you have your terminal window . . .  
 
If you are using Putty or a similar SSH program and you remembered to put in the “ssh” text file in the boot folder then you have connected to your Pi and are 
greeted with the following prompt.

SSH is enabled and the default password for the 'pi' user has not been changed. 

This is a security risk - please login as the 'pi' user and type 'passwd' to set a new password. 

 

Use raspi-config to set the country before use.

*****************************************************************************************************************************************
 
We will be using a number of commands here. Let’s familiarize ourselves with the Pi with the following 
 
sudo raspi-config 

The command will load up a text display you can scroll with the up and down arrow and use the left and right arrows to choose between <select> <finish> <ect...> 
Option (3) Interface Options will let you configure SSH server and enable it. The trick we did previously with the ssh text document was temporary for this first boot. 
We must now go into the config file and set it manually. Scroll to interface options with the up and down arrows, then use the left and right arrows to highlight <Select> 
hit enter and then use the up and down arrows to get to ssh, then the left and right arrows to highlight <Select> and hit enter again. Highlight yes to enable ssh . 
You can use Localization to set your location and your time zone.  Once you have turned on ssh and   
 
APT (Advanced Package Tool) 
APT Is a command and utility that comes with Linux, it is the primary means by which you can install and update/upgrade your Pi. So let's get started.  

 

At the prompt  

Pi@raspberrypi:~ $ [] 
 
type the following command.  

sudo apt update 
 
you may see an output like the following 
Get:1 http://archive.raspberrypi.org/debian buster InRelease [32.6 kB] 

Get:2 http://raspbian.raspberrypi.org/raspbian buster InRelease [15.0 kB]

115 packages can be upgraded. Run 'apt list --upgradable' to see them. 

Pi@raspberrypi:~ $ [] 

 

You have just updated the list of applications to upgrade for your Pi’s OS. Type the following command to continue 

sudo apt full-upgrade 
 
at the bottom of the wall of text that is outputted to you screen, the las like should read 

After this operation, 25.6 MB of additional disk space will be used. Continue (y/n)  
 
type Y and your Pi will update it’s Operating system and necessary utilities to their latest versions.  Using full-upgrade will update all dependencies 
associated with any applications that are being updated. 

Once the upgrade is done, type 

sudo reboot 

This will reboot your system. If you configured ssh correctly, you should be able to log in with your ssh client.  

 

Are you having problems logging in? Did you reset the password and are you using the old password? Did you use  sudo raspi-config  to enable ssh? Read through the 
this section again line 44-48 and make sure you didn’t skip any steps.
